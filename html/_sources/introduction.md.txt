# Argument Quality
## arg_dimensions: Argument Quality Aspects (Turn-Level)
This module evaluates the quality of argumentation in individual discussion turns using the taxonomy proposed by Wachsmuth et al. (2017). Leveraging either OpenAI's language models or a locally hosted Llama model, it assigns scores across multiple dimensions of argument quality, with each dimension rated on a scale from 1 (low) to 3 (high).

#### Logic Dimensions:
-Label 1a-Local Acceptability: Premises of the argument worthy of being believed.

-Label 1b-Local Relevance: Premises support/attack the conclusion of the argument. 

-Label 1c-Local Sufficiency: Premises enough to draw the conclusion of the argument. 

-Label 1_overall-Cogency: Argument has locally acceptable, relevant, and sufficient premises. 

#### Rhetoric Dimensions:
-Label 2a-Credibility: Argument makes the author worthy of credence. 

-Label 2b-Emotional Appeal: Argument creates emotions that make the audience open to it. 

-Label 2c-Clarity: Argument avoids deviation from the issue, and uses correct and unambiguous language. 

-Label 2d-Appropriateness: Language proportional to the issue, supports credibility and emotions. 

-Label 2e-Arrangement: Discussion topic, arguments and conlusions are presented in the right order. 

-Label 2_overall-Effectiveness: Argument persuades the audience. 

#### Dialectic Dimensions:
-Label 3a-Global Acceptability: Audience accepts the use of the argument. 

-Label 3b-Global Relevance: Argument helps arrive at an agreement. 

-Label 3c-Global Sufficiency: Argument adequately rebuts the anticipated counter-arguments to its conclusion. 

-Label 3_overall-Reasonableness: Argument is (globally) acceptable, relevant, and sufficient.

#### Overall Quality:

-Label 4-overall quality: The holistic quality of the argument across all dimensions.

*Note: Requires access to OpenAI’s language models via API, or a locally hosted Llama model.*

                                    )

where dimension (str): The argument quality dimension to evaluate. Choose from:
            - "logic": Evaluates the internal structure and reasoning of the argument.
            - "rhetoric": Assesses the persuasive and stylistic elements.
            - "dialectic": Measures how well the argument contributes to discussion and resolution.
            - "overall": Provides a holistic score across all dimensions.

```
## overall_arg_quality: Overall Argument Quality (Discussion-Level)
This module evaluates the average overall quality of argumentation across the entire discussion. Leveraging either OpenAI’s language models or a locally hosted Llama model, it returns a discussion-level score that reflects the holistic strength of arguments exchanged throughout the discussion.

#### Scoring Modes:

-mode="real": Returns a real-valued score (e.g., 2.7) on a scale from 1 to 5.

-mode="rating": Returns a discrete integer score on a scale from 1 (low) to 3 (high).

*Note: Requires access to OpenAI’s language models via API, or a locally hosted Llama model.*

# Coherence
## coherence_disc: Coherence Analysis (Discussion-Level)
This module assesses the overall coherence of a discussion using OpenAI's language models or a locally hosted Llama model (Zhang et al., 2024). It assesses how logically and contextually connected the messages are across the discussion. The model assigns a coherence score (integer) to the entire discussion on a 1-to-5 scale, where:

- **1** – Poor coherence (incoherent or disjointed)
- **5** – Strong coherence (well-structured and contextually consistent)

*Note: Requires access to OpenAI’s language models via API, or a locally hosted Llama model.*

```python
from discqua import coherence_disc

    coherence_disc_score=coherence_disc(
                                        message_list=message_list,
                                        speakers_list=speakers_list,
                                        disc_id=disc_id,

                                        )
```
## coherence_response: Coherence Analysis (Turn-Level) 
This module evaluates the coherence of individual responses within a discussion. Using OpenAI's language models or a locally hosted Llama model, it examines how well a message aligns with its conversational context. The model assigns a coherence score (integer number) to each response on a 1-to-5 scale:

- **1** – Incoherent response (off-topic, confusing, or disjointed)
- **5** – Coherent (well-aligned with context, clear, and logically structured)

*Note: Requires access to OpenAI’s language models via API, or a locally hosted Llama model.*

```python
from discqua import coherence_response

    score = coherence_response(
                                message_list=message_list,
                                speakers_list=speakers_list,
                                msgsid_list=msgsid_list,
                                disc_id=disc_id,
                                conver_topic=conver_topic,
                                openAIKEY="you key",
                                model_type="openai",
                                model_path="",
                                gpu=False,
                                ctx=1,
                              )
    score = coherence_response(
                                message_list=message_list,
                                speakers_list=speakers_list,
                                msgsid_list=msgsid_list,
                                disc_id=disc_id,

                                model_path="unsloth/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
                                gpu=True,
                                ctx=1,
                              )
```
## coherence_ecoh: Coherence Analysis (Turn-Level) 

This module evaluates the coherence of individual responses within a discussion. Using a locally hosted model presented at Mendonça, Trancoso and Lavie (2024), it examines how well a comment aligns with its conversational context. The model assigns a binary coherence label to each response, where:

- **0** – Incoherent response (off-topic, confusing, or disjointed)
- **1** – Coherent (well-aligned with context, clear, and logically structured)


```python
from discqua import coherence_ecoh

    coherence_booleans = coherence_ecoh(
                                        message_list=message_list,
                                        speaker_list=speakers_list,
                                        disc_id=disc_id,
                                        device="cuda",
                                        )
```
# Controversy
## controversy: Controversy Analysis (Discussion and Turn Level)
This module quantifies the level of controversy in a discussion by analyzing the standard deviation of sentiment scores assigned to individual comments (Avalle et al., 2024). Sentiment scores are derived using a pretrained BERT model.

#### Outputs:

-controversy_per_disc_unorm (discussion_level=True): Sample standard deviation of the unnormalized sentiment scores across all comments in the discussion.

-controversy_per_disc_norm (discussion_level=True): Sample standard deviation of the normalized sentiment scores across the discussion.

-controversy_per_utt_unorm (discussion_level=False): Rolling standard deviation of the unnormalized sentiment scores.

-controversy_per_utt_norm (discussion_level=False): Rolling standard deviation of the normalized sentiment scores.


```python
from discqua import controversy

    unorm_scores, norm_scores = controversy(
                                            message_list=message_list, 
                                            disc_id=disc_id, 
                                            msgsid_list=msgsid_list,
                                            discussion_level=True
                                            )
```

# Dialogue Acts
## dialogue_acts: Dialogue Acts Analysis (Turn-Level).
This module analyzes utterances in a discussion to identify dialogue acts that indicate the deliberative quality of communicative exchanges, following the frameworks presented by Fournier-Tombs and MacKenzie (2021) and Zhang, Culbertson & Paritosh (2017). Leveraging either OpenAI’s language models or a locally hosted Llama model, each utterance is assigned a binary label (1 or 0) to indicate the presence or absence of a specific dialogue act.

#### Dialogue Act Labels:

-Label 0: Interruption - Comment that interrupts a previous utterance.

-Label 1: Explanation - Comment that provides a minimum level of context for the claims or opinions that are expressed.

-Label 2: Causal reasoning - Comment that makes explicit causal connections between any observations, values, or objectives and the claims, conclusions, or recommendations that are made.

-Label 3: Narrative - Comment that employs personall story telling to justify claims or values.

-Label 4: Question - Comment that asks for clarifications or input.

-Label 5: Response - Comment that replies to a question directed toward it.

-Label 6: Advocacy - Comment that explicitly defends or advances the interests or claims of identifiable groups or communities.

-Label 7: Public interest - Comment that attempts to connect claims, policies, or recommendations to the interests of the community as a whole.

-Label 8: Disrespect - Comment that contains insults, dispersions, misrepresentations, name calling, and dismissive or disrespectful statements.

-Label 9: Respect - Comment that contains explicit shows of respect, such as salutations, complements, or apologies.

-Label 10: Counterarguments - Comment that engages with critiques made by other comments or attempts to address or respond to counter claims, concerns, or countervailing evidence.

-Label 11: Constructive proposal - Comment that proposes solutions to shared problems, alternative options, or compromises.

-Label 12: Sarcasm (mocking)- Comment that is primarily a joke, a piece of sarcasm, or a pun intended to get a laugh or be silly but not trying to add information. 

-Label 13: Sarcasm (nomocking)- Comment that uses sarcasm in a non-mocking way (e.g., aimed at devaluing the reference object) but just as a communication function that aligns with the nature of the point that is being made, or necessary to communicate to a particular audience.

*Note: Requires access to OpenAI’s language models via API, or a locally hosted Llama model.*

# Dispute Tactics
## dispute_tactics: Disagreement Levels and Coordination Labels Analysis (Turn-Level).
This module analyzes utterances in a discussion to identify levels of disagreement and markers of coordination, based on the annotation framework introduced by De Kock and Vlachos (2022). Leveraging either OpenAI’s language models or a locally hosted Llama model, each utterance is assigned a binary label (1 or 0) to indicate the presence or absence of a specific disagreement level or coordination label.
#### Disagreement levels:

-Level 0-Name calling/hostility: Comment with direct insults, or use of an equally hostile tone or language. 

-Level 1-Ad hominem/ad argument: Comment that attacks other users to discredit them or their arguments without addressing the content. 

-Level 2-Attempted derailing/off-topic: Comment that is unrelated to the current line of discussion.

-Level 3-Policing the discussion: Comment that does not address (opposing) arguments’ content but mainly try to "policy" the discussion (e.g., telling people to "calm down").

-Level 4a-Stating your stance: Comment that states an opposing view (stance), with little or no supporting evidence.

-Level 4b-Repeated argument: Comment that re-states a previously expressed argument, potentially using different words, but without furthering the discussion.

-Level 5-Counterargument: Comment that states an opposing view (stance), while providing supporting reasoning and/or evidence.

-Level 6-Refutation: Comment that responds to an argument and explains why it is mistaken, using new evidence or reasoning.

-Level 7-Refuting the central point: Comment that directly refutes the central point of an argument, explaining why it is mistaken, using new evidence or reasoning.

### Coordination labels (attempts to promote understanding and consensus):

-Label A-Bailing out: An indication that a person is giving up on a discussion and will no longer engage.

-Label B-Contextualisation: Usually in the first utterance, an individual “sets the stage" by describing what aspect they are 
challenging.

-Label C-Asking questions: Seeking to understand another person’s opinion better. This does not include rhetorical questions, which are generally disagreement moves.

-Label D-Providing clarification: Answering questions or providing information which seeks to create understanding, rather than only furthering a point.

-Label E-Suggesting a compromise: An attempt to find a midway between one’s own point and the opposer’s.

-Label F-Coordinating: In disagreement threads, discussions about edits that may indicate a compromise.

-Label G-Conceding/recanting: An explicit admission that an interlocutor is willing to relinquish their point.

-Label H-I don't know: Admitting that one is uncertain-a signal that the speaker is receptive to the idea that there are unknowns which may impact their argument.

-Label I-Other: For utterances not covered by any other class, for instance, social niceties. 

*Note: Requires access to OpenAI’s language models via API, or a locally hosted Llama model.*

# Diversity
## diversity_disc: Diversity Analysis (Discussion-Level)
This module assesses the diversity of arguments within a discussion using OpenAI's language models or a locally hosted Llama model (Zhang et al., 2024). Diversity in arguments reflects the presence of multiple perspectives, contributing to a richer and more balanced exchange. The model assigns a diversity score (integer number) to the entire discussion on a 1-to-5 scale, where:

- **1** – Poor diversity (high similarity or repetition in arguments)
- **5** – High diversity (broad range of perspectives and reasoning styles)

*Note: Requires access to OpenAI’s language models via API, or a locally hosted Llama model.*

## ngramdiversity: Ngram diversity based on word overlap (Turn-level).
This module analyzes ngram diversity by measuring word overlap between consecutive messages within a discussion (Tan et al., 2016). It focuses on:

-common words (comwords),

-stopwords,

-content words (contwords).

### Labels: Let utt_i, and utt_i+1 two consecutive utterances in the discussion. 
-n_comwords, n_stopwords, n_contwords: Count of overlapping words between utt_i and utt_i+1 (i.e., |utt_i ∩ utt_i+1|).

-reply_fra_comwords, reply_fra_stopwords, reply_fra_contwords: Proportion of overlapping words relative to the reply (i.e., |utt_i ∩ utt_i+1|/|utt_i+1|).

-op_fra_comwords, op_fra_stopwords, op_fra_contwords: Proportion of overlapping words relative to the original message (i.e., |utt_i ∩ utt_i+1|/|utt_i|).

-jac_comwords, jac_stopwords, jac_contwords: Jaccard similarity between the two utterances (i.e., |utt_i ∩ utt_i+1|/|utt_i ∪ utt_i+1|). 


```python
from discqua import ngramdiversity

# Engagement
## engagement_disc: Engagement Analysis (Discussion–Level)
This module assesses the level of engagement within a discussion using OpenAI's language models or a locally hosted Llama model (Zhang et al., 2024). Engagement captures how actively participants contribute and how sustained the interaction is across the discussion. The model assigns an engagement score (integer number) to the entire discussion on a 1-to-5 scale, where:

- **1** – Law engagement (limited interaction, short or shallow exchanges)
- **5** – High engagement (frequent, sustained, and reciprocal participation)

*Note: Requires access to OpenAI’s language models via API, or a locally hosted Llama model.*

## engagement_response: Engagement Analysis (Turn–Level)
This module assigns engagement scores for each response in a discussion using OpenAI's language models or a locally hosted Llama model. Each response is evaluated in context for its engagement quality based on characteristics of variety of response according to the context, likelihood of encouraging the other participant to respond, likelihood of encouraging a quality response from the other participants, interestingness, specificity, and likelihood of creating a sense of belonging for the other participants (Ferron et al., 2023).  The model assigns an engagement score to each response on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where:
- **0** – disengaging.
- **100** – very engaging.

*Note: Requires access to OpenAI’s language models via API, or a locally hosted Llama model.*

```python
from discqua import engagement_response

## reciprocity: Reciprocity Motifs: Serve as proxies for engagement (Discussion and Turn Level)
This module gives the reciprocity motifs proposed by Zhang et al. (2018). These features help uncover participation patterns and interactional dynamics.

-Reciprocity motif: Occurs when the target of a reply returns to respond to the replier.

-External reciprocity motif: Captures the tedency of a comment to draw responses from speakers beyond its explicit target.

-Dyadic interaction motif: Tracks dyadic (back-and-forth) interactions between pairs of participants across the entire discussion.

-Incoming triads: Cases where a speaker receives replies from two different participants.

-Outgoing triads: Instances where a speaker replies to two different participants.

```python
from discqua import reciprocity

# Informativeness
## informativeness_disc: Informativeness Analysis (Discussion-Level)

This module evaluates the informativeness of a discussion using OpenAI's language models or a locally hosted Llama model (Zhang et al., 2024). It estimates how much relevant, useful, and novel information is conveyed by the participants throughout the discussion. The model assigns an informativeness score (integer) to the entire discussion on a 1-to-5 scale, where:

- **1** – Low informativeness (vague, repetitive, or off-topic discussion)
- **5** – High informativeness (substantive, relevant, and information-rich discussion)

*Note: Requires access to OpenAI’s language models via API, or a locally hosted Llama model.*

# Persuasiveness 
## persuasiveness_disc: Persuasiveness Analysis (Discussion-Level)

This module assesses the persuasiveness of arguments exchanged within a discussion using OpenAI's language models or a locally hosted Llama model.The model evaluates the extent to which the arguments are convincing, well-supported, and logically compelling. This reflects the rhetorical strength of the discussion and how effectively participants attempt to sway one another. The model assigns a persuasiveness score (integer) to the entire discussion on a 1-to-5 scale, where:

- **1** – Low persuasiveness.
- **5** – High persuasiveness.

## persuasion_strategy: Persuasiveness Analysis (Turn-Level)
This module analyzes utterances in a discussion to identify persuasion strategies presented by Chen et al. (2025). Leveraging either OpenAI’s language models or a locally hosted Llama model, each utterance is assigned a binary label (1 or 0) indicating the presence or absence of a specific persuasion strategy.
#### Labels:

-Label 0–Presenting Facts: Uses verified evidence and logical reasoning to support a persuasive claim.

-Label 1–Challenging & Questioning: Disputes another viewpoint with skepticism and backs it up with strong counter-evidence.

-Label 2-Emotion Eliciting: Provokes targeted feelings to sway opinions and attitudes.

-Label 3–Self-Modeling: Shares personal actions or choices to set an example and inspire others to do the same.

-Label 4–Building Trust: Promotes mutual understanding through respectful and empathetic dialogue.

-Label 5–Courtesy Tips: Shares thanks, praise, or approval to foster goodwill and reduce tension.

-Label 6-Compromise: Expresses concessions on time to avoid making the discussion too intense causing someone to leave the discussion.

-Label 7-Attaching Views: Shows empathy and attentiveness by echoing another’s perspective with kindness and concern.

-Label 8–Problem Decomposition: Breaks down complex goals into clear, manageable parts to guide discussion, clarify views, and build consensus.

-Label 9-Social Identity: Highlights shared affiliations or values to foster group solidarity and boost persuasive impact.

-Label 10-Herd Mentality: Appeals to popular opinion or social norms to imply that widespread acceptance signals correctness.

-Label 11–Emotive Framing: Expresses a strong personal feeling or tone to deepen impact and emotionally connect with others.

-Label 12–Logical Appeal: Strengthens credibility by using clear logic and sound reasoning to support persuasion.

-Label 13–Task Inquiry: Poses questions that directly relate to achieving persuasive objectives.

-Label 14–Personal Story: Shares a personal experience to inspire, build relatability, and reinforce persuasive impact.

-Label 15–Refutation of Objections: Directly challenges another participant’s viewpoint by presenting counterarguments, evidence, or reasoning.

*Note: Requires access to OpenAI’s language models via API, or a locally hosted Llama model.*

## politeness: Politeness Analysis (Turn-Level)

This module assesses the degree of respect and courtesy expressed in each utterance in a discussion by employing OpenAI's language models or a locally hosted Llama model. The model assigns a politeness label (integer) on a 1-to-3 scale, where:

- **1** – Low levels of respect and courtsey.
- **3** – High levels of respect and courtsey.

*Note: Requires access to OpenAI’s language models via API, or a locally hosted Llama model.*

# Power, Status and Social Bias
## social_bias: Social Bias Analysis (Turn-Level)
This module analyzes utterances in a discussion to identify instances where individuals project social biases and stereotypes onto others, based on pragmatic frames introduced by Sap et al. (2020). Leveraging either OpenAI’s language models or a locally hosted Llama model, each utterance is assigned a binary label (1 or 0) that indicates the presence or absence of a specific type of social bias.

#### Labels:

-Label 0-Offensiveness: Comment is considered offensive, disrespectful, or toxic to anyone/someone.

-Label 1-Intent to offend: The intent of the comment is to be offensive/disrespectful to anyone.

-Label 2-Lewd: The comment contains or alludes to sexual content/acts.

-Label 3-Group implications:The comment implies offense/disrespect towards an identity-related group (e.g., Muslims).

-Label 4-In group language: The comment targets an identity-related group and the author appears to be part of that demographic group.

-Label 5: Other - For comments not covered by the above labels.

*Note: Requires access to OpenAI’s language models via API, or a locally hosted Llama model.*

## coordination: Linguistic Style Coordination (Discussion and Turn Level)
This module computes linguistic coordination metrics either at the discussion or at the utterance level. For each participant in a discussion, analyzes the extent to which they mirror the linguistic style of those they are responding to, as well as how much others, replying to them, imitate their linguistic style (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2012).

-Linguistic Style: articles, auxiliary verbs, conjunctions, adverbs, personal pronouns, impersonal pronouns, prepositions, quantifiers.
#### Labels:
-coord_allspeakers_2_user: Coordination from all speakers toward each user.

-coord_user_2_allspeaker: Coordination from each user toward all other speakers.

-agg1: aggegate measure that does not use smoothing assumptions.

-agg2: aggegate measure that does use smoothing assumptions.

-agg3: aggegate measure that does use (different) smoothing assumptions.

```python
from discqua import coordination

    coordination_scores = coordination(
                                        message_list=message_list,
                                        speakers_list=speakers_list,

                                        )
```
## readability: Readability Analysis (Turn-Level)
This module evaluates each utterance in a discussion using four standard readability metrics (Flesch, 1948; Gunning, 1952; Mc Laughlin, 1969; Kincaid, 1975). These measures help assess the complexity of language used at the turn level.

#### Labels:
-Gunning_Fog: Gunning Fog Index-higher values indicate less readable text.

-Smog: SMOG index-higher values indicate less readable text.

-Flesch: The Flesch Reading Ease score-higher values indicate more readable text.

-Flesch_Kincaid: Flesch-Kincaid index-higher values indicate less readable text.


```python
from discqua import readability
    
    readability_scores = readability(message_list=message_list, msgsid_list=msgsid_list, disc_id=disc_id)

```
# Sentiment
## sentiment: Sentiment Analysis (Turn–Level)
This module assesses the overall emotional tone of each utterance in a discussion by employing OpenAI's language models or a locally hosted Llama model. The model assigns a sentiment label (integer) on a 0-to-2 scale:

- **0** – Negative
- **1** – Neutral
- **2** – Positive

*Note: Requires access to OpenAI’s language models via API, or a locally hosted Llama model.*

# Toxicity 
## toxicity: Toxicity Analysis (Turn–Level)
This module assesses the toxicity level of each utterance in a discussion by employing OpenAI's language models or a locally hosted Llama model. The model assigns a toxicity label (integer) on a 1-to-5 scale:

- **1** – Not Toxic
- **5** – Extremely Toxic (highly offensive, threatening, or likely to push others out of the conversation)

*Note: Requires access to OpenAI’s language models via API, or a locally hosted Llama model.*

```python
from discqua import toxicity
    toxicity_scores = toxicity(

# Turn Taking 
## participation: Participation Analysis (Discussion and Turn Level)
This module computes the entropy of number of messages and word counts per participant to evaluate participation balance (Niculae and Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, 2016). Values close to 1 indicate balanced contributions across participants, while values closer to 0 suggest a dominant speaker driving most of the discussion.

```python
from discqua import participation

    entropy_scores =participation(
                                    message_list=message_list,
                                    speakers_list=speakers_list,
                                    msgsid_list=msgsid_list,
                                    disc_id=disc_id,
                                    discussion_level=False,
                                 )
```
## make_visualization: (Discussion-Level)
Generates a PNG image that visualizes turn-taking behavior, highlighting how speakers alternate and interact throughout the discussion.

```python
from discqua import make_visualization

    make_visualization(
                        message_list=message_list,
                        speakers_list=speakers_list,
